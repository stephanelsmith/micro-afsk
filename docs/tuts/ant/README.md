# 144.39MHz 1/4 Wave Ground Plane Antenna Design

[I used a fantastic online calculator](https://m0ukd.com/calculators/quarter-wave-ground-plane-antenna-calculator/) for 1/4 Wave Ground Plane Antenna.  I've had a lot of success with this calculator.  I normally make the leads a little longer, then trim down until I hit my target.
